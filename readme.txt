Build beautiful layouts quickly and easily using your favourite theme with this frontend drag and drop page builder.

== Description ==

[Tailor](http://gettailor.com/) is a simple yet powerful plugin that allows you to easily create stunning pages using an intuitive drag and drop interface.  Everything is done in the frontend of your website, meaning that what you see is what you get. The best part is that it’s all completely free!

To get started, refer to our [documentation](https://tailor.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/categories/202586427-Getting-started).

= Easy to use =

Drag and drop elements relative to one another and then customize them using a set of intelligent (and intelligible) options.  You'll be up and running in minutes and can use all that saved time for more important things - like creating content!

= Easy to extend =

Adding your own custom elements or functionality is easy.

To learn more about how to create your own extensions, check out our [developer documentation](https://tailor.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/categories/203117247-Extending).  Our simple [Portfolio extension](https://wordpress.org/plugins/tailor-portfolio/) is an example of how to add a custom content element to display a post type.

= Works with any theme =

You can use Tailor with any free or premium theme.

By taking care of the layout and providing basic styles for elements, Tailor leaves a majority of the page style to your selected theme (as it should).

= Free and open-source =

Tailor is completely free and open-source.
