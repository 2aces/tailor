Build beautiful page layouts quickly and easily using your favourite theme.

== Description ==

[Tailor](http://gettailor.com/) is a simple yet powerful plugin that allows you to easily create stunning pages using an intuitive drag and drop interface.  Everything is done in the frontend of your website, meaning that what you see is what you get. The best part is that it’s all completely free!

= Easy to use =

Drag and drop elements relative to one another and then customize them using a set of well-thought-out options.  You'll be up and running in minutes and can use all that saved time for more important things like creating content!

= Easy to extend =

Adding your own custom elements or functionality is easy.

The new [Portfolio extension](https://wordpress.org/plugins/tailor-portfolio/) can be used to display project posts within your site or as the basis for your own custom elements and functionality.

= Works with any theme =

You can use Tailor with any (well coded) free or premium theme. Tailor empowers you to create layouts not possible using the standard editor and leaves a majority of the page style to your selected theme (as it should).

= Free and open-source =

Tailor is completely free and open-source. Use it to help create your next website or contribute to the project on [Github](https://github.com/andrew-worsfold/tailor/)

We're keen to get your feedback so that we can make Tailor better!  Contribute to the GitHub project, leave a comment on the WordPress plugin page or get in touch on Twitter ([@tailorwp](https://twitter.com/tailorwp) or [@andrewjworsfold](https://twitter.com/andrewjworsfold))

Navigate to the page that you would like to Tailor and simply select the "Tailor this Page" (or other allowable post type) option from the WordPress Admin Bar.

Yes, however, users should be directed to the WordPress plugin repository to install the latest version of the plugin.  Consider using a tool like [TGM Plugin Activation](http://tgmpluginactivation.com/) to guide users through the installation process.
