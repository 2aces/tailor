Create beautiful page layouts quickly and easily using your favourite theme.

== Description ==

[Tailor](http://gettailor.com/) is a simple yet powerful plugin that allows you to easily create stunning pages using an intuitive drag and drop interface.  Everything is done in the frontend of your website, meaning that what you see is what you get. The best part is that it’s all completely free!

= Easy to use =

Drag and drop elements relative to one another and then customize them using a set of well-thought-out options.  You'll be up and running in minutes and can use all that saved time for more important things like creating content!

= Easy to extend =

Adding your own custom elements is easy.  Tailor can help your create both simple and complex page layouts and with our upcoming range of extensions you’ll be able to create portfolios and shopfronts all with the click of your mouse!

= Works with any theme =

You can use Tailor with any (well coded) free or premium theme. Tailor empowers you to create layouts not possible using the standard editor and leaves a majority of the page style to your selected theme (as it should).

= Free and open-source =

Despite being full of premium features, Tailor is completely free and open-source. Use it to help create your next website or contribute to the project on [Github](https://github.com/andrew.worsfold/tailor/)

We're keen to get your feedback so that we can make Tailor better!  Say hi at [@tailorwp](https://twitter.com/tailorwp) or [@andrewjworsfold](https://twitter.com/andrewjworsfold)
