A free frontend page builder to make any off-the-shelf WordPress theme fit your content perfectly.

== Description ==

Tailor is a free frontend page builder plugin that allows you to create beautiful layouts for your content quickly and easily using a simple and intuitive drag-and-drop interface.  Coding skills are not required and what you see is truly what you get.

= Fast and easy to use =

Creating complex layouts is easy with Tailor.  Drag and drop elements relative to one another and then customize them using a set of well-thought-out options.

You'll be up and running in minutes and can use all that saved time for more important things like creating content!

= Well designed =

It's only fitting that a plugin that helps you design pages is itself well designed.

We've built Tailor using the latest web technologies and based on industry best practices.  Speed, security, and extensibility were our key areas of focus and we're sure that you'll appreciate the time and effort that has gone into this software. Most importantly, Tailor extends WordPress instead of trying to reinvent those things that WordPress already does well.

= Works with any theme =

You can use Tailor with any (well coded) free or premium theme.

Plugins and themes are separate things within the WordPress world, each with their own purpose. Plugins should extend WordPress' functionality while themes provide the look and feel of a website.  Tailor empowers you to create layouts not possible using the standard editor and leaves a majority of the page style to your selected theme (as it should).

We've also adopted WordPress' "Decisions, not Options" philosophy, so you will not be overwhelmed with unnecessary configuration options.  Those that are included, however, are well-thought-out and offer tremendous amounts of flexibility.

= Highly extensible =

Tailor is designed to be easy to use for even non-technical users, allowing them to create amazing pages without having to write a single line of code.  It is also incredibly extensible.

Anyone with knowledge of PHP, JavaScript and CSS can extend the plugin itself, modify existing elements or even create new ones to achieve a precise look and feel!

Whether you are wanting to add your own functionality to the plugin or simply create a new element, you'll be able to do so in minutes.

 Not every website will be an online store or contain a forum, which is why these types of websites will be addressed under separate Tailor extensions.

= Free (now and forever) =

Despite being full of premium features, Tailor is completely free and open-source.

Use it to help create your next website or contribute to the project on [Github](https://github.com/andrew.worsfold/tailor/)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I get started? =

Navigate to the page that you would like to Tailor and simply select the "Tailor this Page" option from the WordPress Admin Bar.

= Can I move Tailored pages to another WordPress site? =

Yes.  Tailored pages can be migrated like any other type of page using the [duplicator](https://wordpress.org/plugins/duplicator/) plugin.

= Can I include Tailor as part of my theme bundle? =

Yes, however, users should be directed to the WordPress plugin repository to install the latest version of the plugin.  Consider using a tool like [TGM Plugin Activation](http://tgmpluginactivation.com/) to guide users through the installation process.
