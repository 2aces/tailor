## Starting Tailor

The easiest way to begin Tailoring a page is to select the <b>Tailor this Page</b> option from the Admin Bar.  You can do this from the administrator backend when editing a page, or when viewing it in the frontend.

## Configuring Tailor

To access the Tailor Settings page in the administrator backend:

1. Click on Settings.

2. Click on Tailor.

This page allows you to, among other things, specify the post types that can be edited and the user roles that can use the tool.

After making the necessary configuration changes, click on the Save button to ensure your settings are saved.

### Adding a custom icon kit

Tailor allows you to add icons to certain elements (e.g., buttons).

To add a new icon kit:

1. Click on the <b>Add kit</b> button.

2. Select or upload a compressed icon kit created using the <a href="https://icomoon.io/app/">Icomoon</a> tool.

Icon kits can be deactivated or, in the case of custom icon kits, deleted.
