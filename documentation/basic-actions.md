## Adding a new element

To add a new element to the page drag any element from the <b>Elements</b> panel into the desired position on the page.

The insertion guide indicates where the element will be placed (as well as where the element <i>can</i> be placed).

## Moving and copying elements

To move an element on the page, simply drag it to a new position.

To move a higher-order element instead of one of its children, click on one of the children and select the desired element from the hierarchy menu.   Once selected, drag it to the new position.

To copy an element, hold the <kbd>Shift</kbd> while dragging it.

## Creating a new row/column layout

To create a new row/column layout, drag a new or existing element to the left or right of an existing element.  If you drag the element to the left or right of an existing column, a new column will be added to that row.

Columns can be reordered within a row by simply dragging it to a new position.

## Editing an element

Each element has a set of configuration options associated with it.  In order to edit an element either:

1. Click on the element and select <b>Edit</b> from the context menu; or

2. Click on the element while holding the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key.

The <b>Edit</b> dialog window will appear.

This window can be moved, resized and snapped to the left-, top- and right-hand sides of the screen.  After modifying one or more of the configuration options, you can preview the changes or apply them to the element (which will close the window).  Closing the window without applying the changes will prompt the user for confirmation.

## Creating a new template

Templates are saved elements or layouts that can be applied to any page.

You can chose to save a single element, a set of elements or the entire page.

To create a new template:

1. Navigate to the <b>Templates</b> panel.

2. Select an element (which may contain child elements) on the page, or select none to save the entire page.

3. Click on the <b>Save template</b> button.

4. Enter a name for the template in the <b>Save Template</b> dialog.

Duplicate template names are allowed, however for the purposes of managing templates we recommend that you give them unique names.
 
## Adding a template

Adding an existing template to the page is as simple as dragging it from the <b>Templates</b> panel into the desired position on the page.

Please note that the allowed positions are determined by the type of element(s) the template represents.  For example, a template comprising a customized column can only be dragged to the left or right of another column.
